# Spring-1944-unit-icons
A set of new, unit specific icons for the game Spring 1944.



This is an initial test batch of unit icons for Spring 1944.

It features 12 unit icons for the British faction, along with the necessary coding.

To install, simply merge with your spring1944-master folder, and allow it to overwrite. A folder of backup files is included.

I am still learning to do this, so some icons will be better than others.
